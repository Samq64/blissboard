# Bliss Board for C.A.R.E.

The unofficial GitHub pages site for C.A.R.E. to speed up bliss board conversations.

## Setup

The site loads a JSON file using `fetch()`, so it needs to be run with an HTTP server. If Python is installed it can be done by running `python3 -m http.server`.

## Scratch version

The Scratch version is still available in the `scratch` directory. It won't load in the offical editor but can be opened in TurboWarp [here](https://turbowarp.org/?project_url=samq64.github.io/blissboard/scratch/BlissBoard.sb3&size=216x360). The project is packaged using the [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/).
