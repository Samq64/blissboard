# Bliss Board for CARE

A webpage for [CARE](https://www.carecentre.org/) that converts 4-digit codes to words.

## Setup

Simply clone the repository and start an HTTP server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samq64/blissboard
cd blissboard
python -m http.server
```

## Scratch version

The Scratch version is still available in the `scratch` directory but it will not load in the official editor since it relies on SheepTester's utilities extension. The project is packaged using the [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/).
